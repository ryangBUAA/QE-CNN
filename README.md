# Supporting Document of QE-CNN

Three frames are selected from \textit{BQMall}, \textit{Cactus} and \textit{PeopleOnStreet} for evaluating the subjective quality performance of our QE-CNN method and the conventional AR-CNN and DCAD methods. the figure below shows the three frames compressed by HEVC and then enhanced by AR-CNN, DCAD and QE-CNN. In this figure, the raw frames are also shown for comparison. As shown, our QE-CNN method effectively reduces the artifacts, e.g., blurring and ringing effects, caused by HEVC compression, and is clearly better than the conventional AR-CNN and DCAD methods in reducing HEVC compression artifacts.
